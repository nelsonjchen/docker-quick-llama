# oobabooga Text generation web UI Llama Docker Toolkit

*WIP as the situation is rapidly, rapidly evolving.*

This is a toolkit to run "Text generation web UI" from [oobabooga](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) with Llama weights on [vast.ai](https://vast.ai).

It does not include the Llama weights, but it does pre-install some dependencies and utilities that one may find helpful to download LLama weights, if they are a researcher or not.

The toolkit also pre-does lot of the steps from their wiki:

https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/wiki/LLaMA-model

The outputs of this toolkit are this guide with some rough guidance, and an accessible Docker image with 90% of the work done.

## Usage

There may be other services other than vast.ai but for now, this is the only one that the guide will discuss.

### Vast.ai

You should already have a vast.ai account and have loaded it with some money.
